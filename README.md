## Abstract

> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a popular choice of model for tasks in computer vision. When CNNs are made with many layers, resulting in a deep neural network, skip connections may be added to create an easier gradient optimization problem while retaining model expressiveness. In this paper, we show that arbitrarily complex, trained, linear CNNs with skip connections can be simplified into a single-layer model, resulting in greatly reduced computational requirements during prediction time. We also present a method for training nonlinear models with skip connections that are gradually removed throughout training, giving the benefits of skip connections without requiring computational overhead during prediction time. These results are demonstrated with computational examples on Residual Networks (ResNet) architecture.
